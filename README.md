## Areas of improvement
1. There can be a search box to search for a specific repository instead of scrolling thru entire list.
2. Implementing pagination, if the api returns a huge list it will be better to implement pagination to improve performance.
3. Making UI better by adding some loading spinners, better styling
4. Rate limiting on how many times one user can hit the API to prevent DoS attacks.
